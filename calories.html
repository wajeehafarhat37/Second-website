            <p class="morelinespace">This Calorie Calculator is based on several equations, and the results of the
                calculator are based on an estimated average. The Harris-Benedict Equation was one of the earliest
                equations used to calculate basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the amount of energy expended per day
                at rest. It was revised in 1984 to be more accurate and was used up until 1990, when the Mifflin-St Jeor
                Equation was introduced. The Mifflin-St Jeor Equation also calculates BMR, and has been shown to be more
                accurate than the revised Harris-Benedict Equation. The Katch-McArdle Formula is slightly different in
                that it calculates resting daily energy expenditure (RDEE), which takes lean body mass into account,
                something that neither the Mifflin-St Jeor nor the Harris-Benedict Equation do. Of these equations, the
                Mifflin-St Jeor Equation is considered the most accurate equation for calculating BMR with the exception
                that the Katch-McArdle Formula can be more accurate for people who are leaner and know their body fat
                percentage. The three equations used by the calculator are listed below:</p>

            <br>
            <p class="morelinespace">The value obtained from these equations is the estimated number of calories a
                person can consume in a day to maintain their body-weight, assuming they remain at rest. This value is
                multiplied by an activity factor (generally 1.2-1.95) dependent on a person's typical levels of
                exercise, which accounts for times during the day when a person is not at rest. 1 pound, or
                approximately 0.45 kg, equates to about 3,500 calories. As such, in order to lose 1 pound per week, it
                is recommended that 500 calories be shaved off the estimate of calories necessary for weight maintenance
                per day. For example, if a person has an estimated allotment of 2,500 calories per day to maintain
                body-weight, consuming 2,000 calories per day for one week would theoretically result in 3,500 calories
                (or 1 pound) lost during the period.</p>
            <p class="morelinespace">It is important to remember that proper diet and exercise is largely accepted as
                the best way to lose weight. It is inadvisable to lower calorie intake by more than 1,000 calories per
                day, as losing more than 2 pounds per week can be unhealthy, and can result in the opposite effect in
                the near future by reducing metabolism. Losing more than 2 pounds a week will likely involve muscle
                loss, which in turn lowers BMR, since more muscle mass results in higher BMR. Excessive weight loss can
                also be due to dehydration, which is unhealthy. Furthermore, particularly when exercising in conjunction
                with dieting, maintaining a good diet is important, since the body needs to be able to support its
                metabolic processes and replenish itself. Depriving the body of the nutrients it requires as part of
                heavily unhealthy diets can have serious detrimental effects, and weight lost in this manner has been
                shown in some studies to be unsustainable, since the weight is often regained in the form of fat
                (putting the participant in a worse state than when beginning the diet). As such, in addition to
                monitoring calorie intake, it is important to maintain levels of fiber intake as well as other
                nutritional necessities to balance the needs of the body.</p>

            <h2>Calorie Counting as a Means for Weight Loss</h2>
            <p>Calorie counting with the intent of losing weight, on its simplest levels, can be broken down into a few
                general steps:</p>
            <ol class="morelinespace">
                <li>Determine your BMR using one of the provided equations. If you know your body fat percentage, the
                    Katch-McArdle Formula might be a more accurate representation of your BMR. Remember that the values
                    attained from these equations are approximations and subtracting exactly 500 calories from your BMR
                    will not necessarily result in exactly 1 pound lost per week &ndash; it could be less, or it could
                    be more!</li>
                <li>Determine your weight loss goals. Recall that 1 pound (~0.45 kg) equates to approximately 3500
                    calories, and reducing daily caloric intake relative to estimated BMR by 500 calories per day will
                    theoretically result in a loss of 1 pound a week. It is generally not advisable to lose more than 2
                    pounds per week as it can have negative health effects, i.e. try to target a maximum daily calorie
                    reduction of approximately 1000 calories per day. Consulting your doctor and/or a registered
                    dietician nutritionist (RDN) is recommended in cases where you plan to lose more than 2 pounds per
                    week. </li>
                <li>Choose a method to track your calories and progress towards your goals. If you have a smartphone,
                    there are many easy-to-use applications that facilitate tracking calories, exercise, and progress,
                    among other things. Many, if not all of these, have estimates for the calories in many brand-name
                    foods or dishes at restaurants, and if not, they can estimate calories based on the amount of the
                    individual components of the foods. It can be difficult to get a good grasp on food proportions and
                    the calories they contain &ndash; which is why counting calories (as well as any other approach) is
                    not for everyone &ndash; but if you meticulously measure and track the number of calories in some of
                    your typical meals, it quickly becomes easier to accurately estimate calorie content without having
                    to actually measure or weigh your food each time. There are also websites that can help to do the
                    same, but if you prefer, manually maintaining an excel spreadsheet or even a pen and paper journal
                    are certainly viable alternatives.</li>
                <li>Track your progress over time and make changes to better achieve your goals if necessary. Remember
                    that weight loss alone is not the sole determinant of health and fitness, and you should take other
                    factors such as fat vs. muscle loss/gain into account as well. Also, it is recommended that
                    measurements are taken over longer periods of time such as a week (rather than daily) as significant
                    variations in weight can occur simply based on water intake or time of day. It is also ideal to take
                    measurements under consistent conditions, such as weighing yourself as soon as you wake up and
                    before breakfast, rather than at different times throughout the day. </li>
                <li>Keep at it!</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="morelinespace">The above steps are an attempt at the most basic form of calorie counting. Calorie
                counting is not an exact science, and can be as complex as you want to make it. The above does not
                consider the proportions of macronutrients consumed. While there is no exactly known, ideal proportion
                of macronutrients (fats, proteins, carbohydrates), some balance is certainly advisable, and different
                foods have been found to have different effects on health, feelings of hunger, and number of calories
                burned. Generally, minimally processed plant and animal foods tend to be more conducive to healthy
                weight loss and maintenance.</p>
            <p class="morelinespace">There are many approaches to weight loss and there is no set ideal method that
                works for all people, which is why so many different diets and exercise regimens exist. While some
                methods are more effective for each individual person, not all weight loss methods are equivalent, and
                studies suggest that some approaches are healthier than others. That being said, one of the most
                commonly effective weight loss methods is counting calories. In its most basic form, calories consumed
                minus calories expended will result in weight gain if the result is positive, or weight loss if the
                result is negative. However, this is far from a comprehensive picture, and many other factors play a
                role in affecting healthy, sustainable weight loss. For example, there exist conflicting studies
                addressing whether or not the type of calories or foods consumed, or how they are consumed, affects
                weight loss. Studies have shown that foods that require a person to chew more and are more difficult to
                digest result in the body burning more calories, sometimes referred to as the thermic effect of food.
                While the increase in burned calories may be marginal, foods that are more difficult to digest such as
                vegetables generally tend to be healthier and provide more nutrients for fewer calories than many
                processed foods.</p>
            <p class="morelinespace">Consistent with the view that in regards to weight loss, only net calories are
                important and not their source, there exist cases such as the Twinkie diet, where a person that solely
                counted calories while eating a variety of cake snacks managed to lose 27 pounds over two months. As
                effective as this can be, it is certainly not suggested. While the participant did not seem to suffer
                any noticeable health detriments in this particular case, there are other less measurable factors that
                should be considered such as long-term effects of such a diet on potential for developing cancers, heart
                disease, and diabetes. However, ignoring efficiency and health, sustained, significant reduction of
                caloric intake or increase of physical activity should result in weight loss, and counting calories can
                be an effective way to achieve this sole result.</p>
            <p class="morelinespace">Aside from being one viable method for facilitating weight loss, calorie counting
                has other somewhat less quantifiable advantages including helping to increase nutritional awareness.
                Many people are completely unaware of, or grossly underestimate their daily caloric intake. Counting
                calories can help raise awareness of different types of foods, the number of calories they contain, and
                how these calories have a different effect on a person's feelings of satiety. Once a person has a better
                understanding of how many calories are actually in that bag of chips that they can so easily inhale
                within minutes, how much of their daily caloric intake it consumes, and how little the chips do to
                satiate their hunger, portion control and avoidance of foods with empty calories tends to become easier.
            </p>
            <p class="morelinespace">Having actual caloric measurements can also assist in weight loss, since tangible
                calorie goals can be set, rather than simply trying to eat less. Also, although this is not necessarily
                directly related to calorie counting, studies have shown that portion control by simply eating from a
                smaller plate can help reduce calorie intake, since people tend to fill their plates and eat everything
                on their plates. Many people do not realize that they are overeating, since they have become accustomed
                to restaurant-sized portions being the norm, when said portions can be up to three or more times larger
                than necessary for a typical meal. </p>
            <p class="morelinespace">Tracking calories also puts exercise in a quantifiable perspective, increasing a
                person's awareness regarding how much exercise is really required to counteract a 220-calorie bag of
                M&M's. Once a link is made between the amount of exercise that some snack equates to, many people find
                abstaining from that bag of chips to be the preferred option rather than performing an equivalent amount
                of exercise &ndash; which can lead to healthier eating habits. </p>
            <p class="morelinespace">In the end, however, what's important is picking a strategy that works for you.
                Calorie counting is only one method used to achieve weight loss amongst many, and even within this
                method, there are many possible approaches a person can take. Finding an approach that fits within your
                lifestyle that you think you would be able to adhere to is likely going to provide the most sustainable
                option and desirable result. </p>

            <h3>Zigzag Calorie Cycling</h3>
            <p class="morelinespace">Zigzag calorie cycling is a weight loss approach that aims to counteract the human
                body's natural adaptive tendencies. Counting and restricting calories, as described above, is a viable
                method to lose weight, but over a period of time, it is possible for the body to adapt to the lower
                number of calories consumed. In cases where this happens, a plateau in weight loss that can be difficult
                to surmount can result. This is where zigzag calorie cycling can help, by not allowing the body to adapt
                to the lower calorie environment.</p>
            <p class="morelinespace">Zigzag calorie cycling involves alternating the number of calories consumed on a
                given day. A person on a zigzag diet should have a combination of high-calorie and low-calorie days to
                meet the same overall weekly calorie target. For example, if your target calorie intake is 14,000
                calories per week, you could consume 2,300 calories three days a week, and 1,775 the other four days of
                the week, or you could consume 2,000 calories each day. In both cases, 14,000 calories would be consumed
                over the week, but the body wouldn't adapt and compensate for a 2,000-calorie diet. This also allows a
                person more flexibility in their diet, allowing them to plan around occasions, such as work or family
                gatherings, where a person may consume more calories. Consuming a lower number of calories on other days
                can allow a person to enjoy these gatherings or even have a "cheat day" where they eat whatever they
                want without feeling guilty, since they can make up for the excess calories on their low-calorie days.
            </p>
            <p class="morelinespace">There is no concrete rule or study that dictates the most effective way to
                alternate or spread out calorie consumption. How to vary calorie intake is largely up to personal
                discretion. Depending on a person's activity, it is generally recommended that the high-calorie and
                low-calorie days vary by approximately 200-300 calories, where the high-calorie day is often the number
                of calories a person needs to consume to maintain their current weight. For a person with a higher
                activity level, the calorie difference should be larger. The calculator presents two zigzag diet
                schedules. The first schedule has two higher calorie days and five lower calorie days. The second
                schedule increases and reduces calories gradually. In either case, the total weekly calorie consumption
                is the same.</p>
            <p class="morelinespace">In the end, regardless of what method you choose to use when approaching weight
                loss, what's important is picking a strategy that works for you. Calorie counting and zigzag calorie
                cycling are only two methods (that are fairly interrelated) used to achieve weight loss among many, and
                even within these methods, there are many possible approaches a person can take. Finding an approach
                that fits within your lifestyle that you think you would be able to adhere to is likely going to provide
                the most sustainable and desirable result.</p>

            <h2>How Many Calories Do You Need?</h2>
            <p class="morelinespace">Many people seek to lose weight, and often the easiest way to do this is to consume
                fewer calories each day. But how many calories does the body actually need in order to be healthy? This
                largely depends on the amount of physical activity a person performs each day, and regardless of this,
                is different for all people &ndash; there are many different factors involved, not all of which are
                well-understood or known. </p>
            <p class="morelinespace">Some factors that influence the number of calories a person needs to remain healthy
                include age, weight, height, sex, levels of physical activity, and overall general health. For example,
                a physically active 25-year-old male that is 6 feet in height requires considerably higher calorie
                intake than a 5-foot-tall, sedentary 70-year-old woman. Though it differs depending on age and activity
                level, adult males generally require 2,000-3000 calories per day to maintain weight while adult females
                need around 1,600-2,400 according to the U.S Department of Health.</p>
            <p class="morelinespace">The body does not require many calories to simply survive. However, consuming too
                few calories results in the body functioning poorly, since it will only use calories for functions
                essential to survival, and ignore those necessary for general health and well-being. Harvard Health
                Publications suggests women get at least 1,200 calories and men get at least 1,500 calories a day unless
                supervised by doctors. As such, it is highly recommended that a person attempting to lose weight
                monitors their body's caloric necessities and adjusts them as necessary to maintain its nutritional
                needs.</p>


            <h2>Calories: Different Kinds and Their Effects</h2>
            <p class="morelinespace">The main sources of calories in a typical person's diet are carbohydrates,
                proteins, and fat, with alcohol also being a significant portion of calorie intake for many people
                (though ideally this should be limited since alcohol contains many empty calories). Some studies have
                shown that the calories displayed on nutrition labels and the calories actually consumed and retained
                can vary significantly. This hints at the complex nature of calories and nutrition and is why many
                conflicting points of view on the "best" methodology for losing weight exist. For example, how a person
                chews their food has been shown to affect weight loss to some degree; generally speaking, chewing food
                more increases the number of calories that the body burns during digestion. People that chew more also
                tend to eat less, since the longer period of time necessary to chew their food allows more time to reach
                a state of satiety, which results in eating less. However, the effects of how food is chewed and
                digestion of different foods are not completely understood and it is possible that other factors exist,
                and thus this information should be taken with a grain of salt (in moderation if weight loss is the
                goal). </p>
            <p class="morelinespace">Generally, foods that take more effort to chew &ndash; fruit, vegetables, lean
                meats, whole grains, etc. &ndash; require the body to burn more calories since more calories are
                required to digest them. It also results in the feeling of satiety for longer periods of time.
                Furthermore, certain foods like coffee, tea, chilies, cinnamon, and ginger have been found to increase
                the rate of calories burned, due to the ingredients they contain.</p>
            <p class="morelinespace">The "quality" of calories consumed is also important. There are different
                classifications of foods in terms of calories. This includes high-calorie foods, low-calorie foods, and
                empty calories. Consistent with their naming, high-calorie foods are foods that are calorically dense,
                meaning that there are a high number of calories relative to serving size, while low-calorie foods have
                fewer calories relative to serving size. Foods such as fat, oils, fried foods, and sugary foods are
                examples of high-calorie foods. Being a high-calorie food does not inherently mean that the food is
                unhealthy however &ndash; avocados, quinoa, nuts, and whole grains are all high-calorie foods that are
                considered healthful in moderation. Low-calorie foods include vegetables and certain fruits, among other
                things, while empty calories, such as those in added sugars and solid fats, are calories that contain
                few to no nutrients. Studies have shown that there is a measurable difference between consuming 500
                calories of carrots compared to 500 calories of popcorn. As previously mentioned, this in part can be
                attributed to differences in how the foods are consumed and processed. Carrots require far more chewing
                and can result in more calories burned during digestion. Again, the mechanism for these differences is
                not fully defined, but simply note that for weight loss purposes, the general formula of calories in
                minus calories out determining weight gain or loss does hold, but that the number of calories on a
                nutrition label is not necessarily indicative of how many calories the body actually retains. While
                there is no clear-cut or ideal amount of macronutrient proportions a person should consume to maintain a
                healthy diet or lose weight, eating a "healthy" diet replete with a variety of unprocessed foods such as
                vegetables, fruits, and lean meats is correlated with being healthier, and is more likely to result in
                sustainable weight loss. Also, remember that calories from drinks comprise an estimated 21% of a typical
                person's diet. Many of these calories fall under the category of empty calories. While sodas are an
                obvious culprit, drinks such as juices and even milk have large amounts of sugar and should be consumed
                in moderation to avoid negating their nutritional benefits. Ideally, a person should drink water, tea,
                and coffee without adding sugar in order to reduce calories gained from drinks.</p>
            <p class="morelinespace">Remember: All foods, including "healthful foods," should be consumed in moderation,
                and distinctions can often be misleading since even natural foods like fruits can have large amounts of
                sugar, and foods labeled as "health foods" such as low-calorie foods, reduced-fat foods, etc. can
                potentially replace one unhealthy component with another. Many reduced-fat foods have large amounts of
                added sugar to compensate for taste lost through fat reduction. It is important to pay attention to, and
                consider the different components in a food product in order to determine whether said food should have
                a place within your diet.</p>
